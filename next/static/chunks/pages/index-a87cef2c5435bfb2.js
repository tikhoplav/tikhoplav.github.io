Mostly those resources were SPAs built with Vue, React and JQuery integrated with a central platform for the sake of providing actual data about goods, prices, discounts, upsales as well as for receiving orders. As a part of those individual projects, my task was to cooperate with different outsource web designers, staff marketers and web advertisement experts and act as a project manager coordinating it.","During that time I’ve managed to integrate multiple third parties services as Paypal, Google Pay, Stripe, 2Checkout, Google Analytics, Google and Yandex Maps, different VOIP services, as well as provided Qnits platform integrations for Keitaro, Wix, WordPress, Joomla, Tilda and others.","The most memorable experience of that time is an implementation of a Telegram bot, which was transferring lead information to the Telegram channel and attaching each individual lead after the staff manager, after the last was providing a special command in the chat. This bot was a part of an attempt to develop a custom CRM system, which was later abandoned in favor of a ready-made solution."]}];function F(){return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(o(),{children:[(0,n.jsx)("title",{children:"Tikhoplav"}),(0,n.jsx)("meta",{name:"description",content:"Generated by create next app"}),(0,n.jsx)("meta",{name:"viewport",content:"width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}),(0,n.jsx)("link",{rel:"icon",href:"/favicon.ico"})]}),(0,n.jsx)("canvas",{style:{display:"block",width:"100%",height:"100vh",backgroundColor:"#222020",position:"fixed"}}),(0,n.jsx)(c(),{src:"/ripple.js"}),(0,n.jsx)(h.xu,{w:"full",position:"absolute",top:"0",children:(0,n.jsxs)(m.W,{size:"full",maxW:"6xl",textStyle:"base",mb:"20",mt:"48vh",children:[(0,n.jsx)(p.X,{as:"h1",size:"4xl",textStyle:"title",mb:"2",children:"Vitaly Tikhoplav"}),(0,n.jsxs)(u.U,{spacing:"3",alignItems:"baseline",mb:"6",children:[(0,n.jsx)(p.X,{size:"lg",children:"Full-Stack software engineer"}),(0,n.jsx)(f.E,{p:"3",children:"since 2017"}),(0,n.jsx)(f.E,{p:"3",children:"$60/hour"})]}),(0,n.jsx)(g.x,{mt:"16",children:(0,n.jsx)(w.i,{children:(0,n.jsxs)(x.p,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(y.Tr,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(v.Th,{children:(0,n.jsx)(M,{boxSize:"6"})}),(0,n.jsx)(b.Td,{children:(0,n.jsx)(j.r,{href:"mailto:tikhoplavspb@gmail.com",children:"tikhoplavspb@gmail.com"})})]}),(0,n.jsxs)(y.Tr,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(v.Th,{children:(0,n.jsx)(E,{boxSize:"6"})}),(0,n.jsx)(b.Td,{children:(0,n.jsx)(j.r,{href:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tikhoplav",children:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tikhoplav"})})]}),(0,n.jsxs)(y.Tr,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(v.Th,{children:(0,n.jsx)(D,{boxSize:"6"})}),(0,n.jsx)(b.Td,{children:(0,n.jsx)(j.r,{href:"https://github.com/tikhoplav",children:"https://github.com/tikhoplav"})})]}),(0,n.jsxs)(y.Tr,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(v.Th,{children:(0,n.jsx)(A,{boxSize:"6"})}),(0,n.jsx)(b.Td,{children:(0,n.jsx)(j.r,{href:"https://discordapp.com/users/6566",children:"tikhoplav#6566"})})]}),(0,n.jsxs)(y.Tr,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(v.Th,{children:(0,n.jsx)(P,{boxSize:"6"})}),(0,n.jsx)(b.Td,{children:(0,n.jsxs)(u.U,{spacing:"3ch",children:[(0,n.jsx)(d(),{width:32,height:19.2,src:"/bulgaria.svg",alt:"Flag of Bulgaria"}),(0,n.jsx)(k.x,{children:"Burgas, Bulgaria"})]})})]})]})})}),(0,n.jsxs)(h.xu,{mt:"16",children:[(0,n.jsx)(p.X,{children:"Core technologies"}),(0,n.jsx)(B,{skills:N})]}),(0,n.jsxs)(h.xu,{mt:"16",children:[(0,n.jsx)(p.X,{children:"Additional tech stack"}),(0,n.jsx)(B,{skills:R})]}),(0,n.jsxs)(h.xu,{mt:"16",children:[(0,n.jsx)(p.X,{children:"Experience"}),G.map((e,t)=>(0,i.createElement)(O,{...e,key:t}))]}),(0,n.jsxs)(h.xu,{mt:"16",children:[(0,n.jsx)(p.X,{children:"Education"}),(0,n.jsxs)(S.Z,{mt:"5",children:[(0,n.jsx)(I.O,{children:(0,n.jsxs)(u.U,{spacing:"5",children:[(0,n.jsx)(z.q,{name:"spbstu",src:"/spbstu.png"}),(0,n.jsxs)(h.xu,{w:"full",children:[(0,n.jsx)(k.x,{fontWeight:"bold",children:"Master's degree Physics (Biophysics)"}),(0,n.jsx)(k.x,{children:"Saint-Petersburg State Polytechnic University"}),(0,n.jsx)(k.x,{fontSize:"xs",children:"2010 - 2016"})]})]})}),(0,n.jsx)(C.e,{pl:"5.5em",children:(0,n.jsx)(k.x,{maxW:"48.5em",children:"I've graduated with a master's degree in physics in 2016, what gave me a mindset suitable to seek, analyze and apply any sort of knowledge.
