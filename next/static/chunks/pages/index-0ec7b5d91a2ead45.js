My goal in scope of a project was to gather all data about incoming leads from all of the resources, accumulate, process and provide a real-time reporting for the company headquarters.","Analytical system was built as a set of 11 microservices specialized on different aspects of a gathering, processing and reporting. Main data storage was based on the Yandex ClickHouse technology, which provided an ability to make real-time selections over billions entities in real time.","Microservices was implemented mostly with use of TypeScript as a standalone remote procedure provider. Interaction between microservices was built using RabbitMQ technology, so that the whole system acts as an event-driven logging machine processing and storing data in real-time.","Reports as sets of tables, multiple charts and graphs, schemas and other visualisations were implemented using Vue, Vuex and mainly Google Charts JS library. Reports were based on the data provided in realtime using Socket.io and the cached version by Express driven API.","- Introduced a Big Data vault for all the company's traffic;\n      - Integrated data with the existing client/project/offer system;\n      - Shipped the simplistic UI to monitor that data in the real time;\n      \n      Data was consolidated through about 20 different SEO resources, 200+ clients and about 100K clicks / actions per day."]},{title:"Qnits",url:"https://qnits.ru",position:"Web Developer",dates:"Oct 2017 - Nov 2018",imageRef:"qnits.jpeg",description:["Qnits is a dropshipping platform distributing goods all over Russia with the use of an advertisement provided by a vast network of partners. The platform is built with the use of a custom PHP framework. I was hired by Qnits to maintain and expand it. My regular duties were to implement new features, provide an API for integration of third party statistics tools, resolve incoming bug reports and implement testing using PHPUnit for the rest of a platform codebase.","In addition to that, I’ve developed multiple lead generating resources in scope of individual contracts. Mostly those resources were SPAs built with Vue, React and JQuery integrated with a central platform for the sake of providing actual data about goods, prices, discounts, upsales as well as for receiving orders. As a part of those individual projects, my task was to cooperate with different outsource web designers, staff marketers and web advertisement experts and act as a project manager coordinating it.","During that time I’ve managed to integrate multiple third parties services as Paypal, Google Pay, Stripe, 2Checkout, Google Analytics, Google and Yandex Maps, different VOIP services, as well as provided Qnits platform integrations for Keitaro, Wix, WordPress, Joomla, Tilda and others.","The most memorable experience of that time is an implementation of a Telegram bot, which was transferring lead information to the Telegram channel and attaching each individual lead after the staff manager, after the last was providing a special command in the chat. This bot was a part of an attempt to develop a custom CRM system, which was later abandoned in favor of a ready-made solution."]}],L=[{title:"CodeSignal - Polyglot Badge",position:"Student",url:"https://app.codesignal.com/profile/tikhoplav/badges",imageRef:"/polyglot.png",dates:"Oct 2023 - Oct 2023",pic:"/polyglot.png",description:["The goal of the project is to complete 10 tasks at codesignal.com in 10 different languages in one day.
